# UMEED
This is a Flutter App made to help fight against the problem of domestic violence.

This app focuses on being anonymous and makes it possible for domestic abuse victims to seek help. To be able to do this the app actually launches as a dummy calculator app so that if the abuser checks the phone of the victim he/she doesnt find anything against them. The victim can then go to the in app settings to click the about us option that redirects them to the actual umeed app.

The victim can then go to the in app settings to click the about us option that redirects them to the actual umeed app.

The user has the option to login as a victim, a worker to help victims or as an admin.

After the login and registration process the user is greeted with 3 huge buttons they can click in case of an emergency.
These buttons perform various actions on being pressed this is possible via the python script we use and the twilio api.

- The low button on being pressed sends a message alert to the contact that you register. The SMS tells that you are in need of help and shows your current location.
- The high risk button on being pressed sends a call to your emergency contact letting them know that you are in need of help.
- The severe button on being pressed means that u are in very serious danger, it sends a  message to your emergency contact and it also informs the law enforcement authorities that you may be in need of immediate help

The second page suggests the victim about some educational content like youtube videos on self defence, contacts of NGOs that help fight domestic violence and also a list of important helplines that could be needed in case of emergency.
Most of these resources are gender neutral as not only women but even men are victims of domestic violence. We also have gender specific resources if the user prefers that.

The next screen is something similar to a speed dial feature where we have listed all the close contacts of the victim, they can add people who they need help from and can access this page to contact them.

The last page shows you the victim profile along with their basic details.
Below that we have attached 2 buttons
- First one helps them access an AI chatbot that works specifically to help domestic abuse patients. I plan to create such a similar thing ourselves and implement this chatbot within our app instead of being externally linked.
- Second button redirects you to a personal chat that the victim can use to anonymusly talk to professionals when they require assistance without the risk of their abuser being able to read those chats.

This app is still under development and requires a lot of changes, any suggestions about new features or ideas you have regarding this app will be appreciated ðŸ˜Š
